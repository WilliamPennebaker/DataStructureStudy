# Just another Data Structure study program

## Overview

After starting to mess with some leetcode problems I realized that using brute force to solve the problem isn't going to be extremely helpful however, it is still a solution. A good general thought is how can I make this solution better (time complexity speaking or code wise I suppose).<br/>
So, I decided to start this project to give a better understanding of what is available to me after taking data structures and algorithm classes at my university. Those classes will only get you so far and it is ultimately up to you to progress that knowledge into something better.<br/>
This project is a collection of the data structures, sorting methods and some notes that I have taking while studying for these solutions. Note that this will just be Java, I currently don't have plans to expand this to C/C++ or python or another programming language for that matter.<br/>
Regardless of what programming language I use or decide to include into this project inteviewers aren't going to care what language you're using on an interview. What they care about is if you can produce a solution (results) and if it is the most efficient solution you can think of. (If it isn't think of one and/or ask them if they were to have a more efficient solution that they could teach you. It does show that you're willing to learn from them.) - Just remember that this may not always be the case and we can never assume!<br/>
I decided to have this as public on github to be used as a resource, not only for me but if someone else stubbles upon this on the massive world of the internet. Hopefully this will be helpful to YOU who is reading this!

## Key Topics
* Data Structures
    * Arrays (Could expand to dynamic arrays)
    * Linked List
    * Stack
    * Queue
    * Binary Tree
    * Binary Search Tree
    * Heap
    * Hashing
    * Graph
* Sorting Algorithms
    * Insertion Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Bubble Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Heap Sort

Note: I will have comments and possibly extra note files explaining the time complexity of each data structure/algorithm. These may not be full definitions or working out completely why the time complexity is what it is but more of a note to remind me of what is needed generally for them.

## Helpful Links/Resources

Some of the links used to code this and work out why some time complextities are the way they are and if there is a more efficient way to a solution.<br/>

This is a website hosted on github that I came across showing the time complexity for different algorithms/data structures and growth rates.<br/>

## Folder Structure

Nothing special, created a new java project in vs code.

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources.
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies.
- `bin`: the folder where complied output files will be generated.
